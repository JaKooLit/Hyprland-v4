### üÜï  What's new compared to my V3
- restructured Install script
-  Can modify the packages easily. (install-scripts/00-hypr-pkgs.sh) edit as desired
-  Added Tokyo-night-theme and TokyoNight-SE icons
-  using dunst instead of mako
-  Added Tokyo-Night SDDM Theme 
-  Use a wofi-power menu instead of wlogout
-  Added the following: 
    - a. mission center (windows like task manager) - right click on cpu waybar module
    - b. nvtop - right click on temperature waybar module

### ‚ú® to run
> clone this repo by using git. Change directory, make executable and run the script
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-v4.git
cd Hyprland-v4
chmod +x install-v4.sh
./install-v4.sh
```
### ‚ú® for ZSH and OH-MY-ZSH installation
> do this once installed and script completed; do the following to change the default shell zsh
```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```
- reboot or logout
- by default gnzh theme is installed. You can find more themes from this [`OH-MY-ZSH-THEMES`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes)
- to change the theme, edit ~/.zshrc ZSH_THEME="desired theme"

### üìí Notes
- super h for launching a small help file
- super e to view / edit settings, monitor, keybinds, Environment Variables, etc
- go through the keybinds. There are alot of hidden features like dual panel, change waybar styles, change wallpaper, etc... its too long to put all in the readme!!!

### üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap:
- [ ] Install zsh and oh-my-zsh without necessary steps above
- [ ] possibly adding gruvbox themes, cursors, icons
- [ ] adding vertical waybar 
- [X] ~~Use kitty in favor of foot~~ - Dropped the idea of kitty. Kitty is using twice memory compared to foot.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è some known issues
- reports from members of my discord, states that some users of nvidia are getting stuck on sddm login. credit  to @Kenni Fix stated was 
```  
 while in sddm press ctrl+alt+F2 or F3
log into your account
`lspci -nn`, find the id of your nvidia card
`ls /dev/dri/by-path` find the matching id
`ls -l /dev/dri/by-path` to check where the symlink points to 
)
7. add "env = WLR_DRM_DEVICES,/dev/dri/cardX" to the ENVvariables config (.config/hypr/configs/ENVariables.conf)  ; X being where the symlink of the gpu points to
```
